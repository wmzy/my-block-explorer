# Feature Specification: [FEATURE NAME]

**Feature Branch**: `[###-feature-name]`  
**Created**: [DATE]  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.

  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P1)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently - e.g.,
"Can be fully tested by [specific action] and delivers [specific value]"]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]
2. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

### User Story 2 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P2)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

### User Story 3 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P3)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

[Add more user stories as needed, each with an assigned priority]

### Edge Cases

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right edge cases.
-->

- What happens when [boundary condition]?
- How does system handle [error scenario]?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right functional requirements.
-->

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST support chain-agnostic operations across all Viem
  chains
- **FR-002**: System MUST maintain 1-9ms response times for cached data
- **FR-003**: All code MUST compile with TypeScript strict mode and zero errors
- **FR-004**: System MUST use DuckDB-PostgreSQL adapter for all database
  operations
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide RESTful APIs with chain-specific endpoints
- **FR-006**: System MUST work out-of-the-box after npm install (zero
  configuration)
- **FR-007**: System MUST achieve minimum 80% test coverage across
  unit/integration/e2e/performance
- **FR-008**: All services MUST be independently testable across different
  chains
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide consistent JSON responses with chain metadata

_Example of marking unclear requirements:_

- **FR-006**: System MUST authenticate users via [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: auth
  method not specified - email/password, SSO, OAuth?]
- **FR-007**: System MUST retain user data for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: retention
  period not specified]

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **[Entity 1]**: [What it represents, key attributes without implementation]
- **[Entity 2]**: [What it represents, relationships to other entities]

## Success Criteria _(mandatory)_

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define measurable success criteria.
  These must be technology-agnostic and measurable.
-->

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Response times for cached data MUST be 1-9ms or better
- **SC-002**: System MUST achieve minimum 80% test coverage across all test
  types
- **SC-003**: All TypeScript compilation MUST pass with zero errors and strict
  mode
- **SC-004**: System MUST support all Viem chains without code changes
- **SC-005**: Frontend MUST auto-discover local server without manual
  configuration
- **SC-006**: API endpoints MUST follow RESTful patterns with chain-specific
  structure
- **SC-007**: Database operations MUST use only DuckDB-PostgreSQL adapter
- **SC-008**: Performance tests MUST verify response time requirements are met
